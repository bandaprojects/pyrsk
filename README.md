## Uuh, what?

This is a pedagogic experiment, made primarily for 4 reasons:

1. To teach Python (and with it, programming, modern engineering tooling, and
   algorithmic thinking) to a group of friends, who all happened to have grown
   up together playing Risk, and somehow have ended up doing all sort of
   important jobs.
2. To end up with a fully functional, fun, multi-player experience for Risk-like
   games.
3. To have a side project that we can hack on to distract ourselves from this
   quite terrible year.
4. For me, @edran, to learn and develop some technical jargon in my
   mothertongue, Italian.
   
The engineering goal is to end up with a cross-compatible & native-feeling
client, and a game server that doesn't suck and that can be easily hosted on
modern platforms.

This is an ambitious project, and quite likely to fail, due to the participants
having almost no software engineering experience. @edran will act as mentor and
supervisor, and will hopefully not write any line of code whatsoever beyond the
initial setup.

There will probably be nothing to see here :) You have been warned. Also, most
of the interaction on this repo will be in Italian, so please forgive us in
advance for the colourful language.

### Is this a good idea?

I don't know. YOLO.
